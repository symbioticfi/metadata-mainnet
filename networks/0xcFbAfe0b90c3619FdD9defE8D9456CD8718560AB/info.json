  "description": "Yodl is a protocol-level coordination network for rule-based execution and settlement using delegated execution credit. Participants authorize bounded execution without custody or pooled capital, while operators execute under protocol-enforced constraints. Yodl enforces authorization limits at execution time and deterministically restores system state after execution. Yodl does not run strategies, select venues, or embed economic guarantees, serving only as a neutral coordination and enforcement layer.",
