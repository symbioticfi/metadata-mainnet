  "description": "The Tanssi Vault allows anyone to stake their TANSSI tokens (ERC-20) and earn incentives for securing the network's growth and reliability. Stakers help provide Ethereum-grade economic security to Tanssi's sovereign appchains, ensuring they remain decentralized, performant, and ready for high-value use cases from day one. Tanssi empowers developers to deploy customizable appchains anchored by Ethereum-backed security, eliminating infrastructure complexities. Purpose-built for demanding applications like Real-World Assets (RWAs), stablecoins, and advanced coordination protocols, Tanssi delivers a complete, production-ready environment through decentralized, automated orchestration—including validator management, rotating sequencers, integrated RPCs, indexers, and explorers provisioned out-of-the-box.",
